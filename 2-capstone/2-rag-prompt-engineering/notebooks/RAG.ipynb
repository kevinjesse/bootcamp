    "Large Language Models have proven to be very good at general question and answering tasks.  However, a main limitation of many LLMs is that they are generally constrained to the data that they are initially trained on.  Without access to an external data source, LLMs cannot bring in new information, whether this is proprietary domain specific knowledge or just an update on an existing knowledge base.  Given that, how can we enable LLMs to be updated with new information while leveraging the powerful language properties?\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to this Retrieval Augumented Generation (RAG).  In RAG, we leverage the fact that LLMs can be prompted with additional context data to add additional relevant context to a given query before we pass it into the model.  The old pipeline would be:\n",
