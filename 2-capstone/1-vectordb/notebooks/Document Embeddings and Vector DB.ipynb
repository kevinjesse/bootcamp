    "A fundamental part of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based systems is the ability to search for documents that are relevant to a given query.  By retrieving these relevant documents, we can inject our prompts with further contextual information, allowing for the LLMs to provide better, grounded answers, often without the need for the LLM to be finetuned off of the data.\n",

    "## 1. Vector Embeddings Conceptually\n",
    "\n",
    "Document retrieval and search systems can be built off of simple heuristic concepts such as the occurence of common words, word counts, dictionaries of synonyms, etc.  Depending on the problem, this can often work fine, however for natural language, this is generally insufficient because of the semantic meaning of words, where the literal words do not carry the meaning or the concept.  As an example, the words \"pencil\" and \"eraser\" are conceptually similar to each other, both relevant to writing, however in a naive literal search system, there is almost nothing linking the two without additional context.  This problem has lead to the development of semantic search [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search], which aims to build search systems for natural language capturing \"semantic\" meaning of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best solutions to pop up for capturing semantics is **Vector Embeddings**, which is the idea that any type of data can be mapped into a vector space, via some embedding function, where in the new space, similar data points are \"close\" to each other.  The problem then becomes, how do you learn this embedding function?  Without diving into too much detail, it turns out that Neural Networks and Deep Learning are able to learn pretty good embedding functions."
